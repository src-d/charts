# Gitbase Web

This chart deploys [Gitbase web](https://github.com/src-d/gitbase-web)

It has two modes:

* It can deploy its own bblfshd and gitbase servers as sidecar containers
  * bblfshd drivers are set explicitly in the configuration to make sure every replica has the same versions. They are downloaded after bblfshd has started
  * To have gitbase data a set of repositories is downloaded before gitbase init. In order to have consistency if multiple replicas are specified a commit hash can be passed.
  * It uses a stateful set to avoid downloading again data for every release
* It can use external bblfshd and gitbase services (see `settings` key in `values.yaml`)
